## 🔥 **Key Notes on File Types & Formats for Data Professionals**

---

### 📂 **1. Know Your File Format Families**

You'll work with **many** file formats. Choosing the right one means understanding:

* Structure
* Compatibility
* Performance needs
* Security

---

### 🔠 **2. Delimited Text Files (CSV, TSV)**

**Used For:** Simple data exchange
**Structure:** Text with delimiters (comma, tab, etc.) separating values

#### ✅ Pros:

* Widely supported
* Human-readable
* Any data type per column
* Flexible field lengths

#### ⚠️ Cons:

* No data types enforced
* Delimiters in data can break parsing (CSV vs TSV)
* No built-in schema or validation

**Examples:**

* **CSV:** Comma-separated (e.g. `name,age,city`)
* **TSV:** Tab-separated (used when commas exist in data)

---

### 📊 **3. Microsoft Excel Open XML Spreadsheet (.XLSX)**

**Used For:** Interactive spreadsheet work, business users

#### ✅ Pros:

* Supports formulas, formatting
* Secure (no malicious macros unless .XLSM)
* Open format (XML-based)
* Multiple sheets

#### ⚠️ Cons:

* Heavier than CSV
* Can be clunky for big data pipelines

---

### 🧾 **4. Extensible Markup Language (XML)**

**Used For:** Web data transmission, system interoperability

#### ✅ Pros:

* Human + machine-readable
* Platform & language independent
* Self-descriptive data

#### ⚠️ Cons:

* Verbose (bloated file size)
* Requires parsing logic
* Not trendy for new APIs (JSON is preferred)

---

### 📄 **5. Portable Document Format (PDF)**

**Used For:** Static, formatted document sharing (legal/financial)

#### ✅ Pros:

* Looks the same on any device
* Good for forms, signatures
* Cross-platform stable

#### ⚠️ Cons:

* Not structured for data extraction
* Hard to automate parsing cleanly

---

### 🌐 **6. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)**

**Used For:** APIs, web apps, structured data exchange

#### ✅ Pros:

* Lightweight, flexible
* Easy to read/write in any language
* Supports nesting, complex structures
* Handles all kinds of data — even audio/video
* Most APIs use it

#### ⚠️ Cons:

* No native support for comments
* Schema-less (so easier to mess up structure)

---

## 🧠 **TL;DR: What to Say in an Interview**

> “I understand that different file formats serve different purposes — for example, CSV is great for lightweight flat data, JSON is ideal for web APIs and nested data, while XLSX is more feature-rich for business use cases. Choosing the right format is about balancing accessibility, performance, and structure.”
